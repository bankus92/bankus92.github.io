        Welcome to my portfolio! I am a Mechanical Project Manager based in
        Columbus, Ohio. I specialize in managing projects from conception to
        completion in the commercial HVAC and Plumbing industry. I have
        experience in project management, engineering, and construction. I am
        also a web developer with a passion for creating and building websites,
        networking, and maintaining data. I have experience with HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. Enough so that I've built this entire portfolio from scratch
        with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

        I have set out and achieved everything that I have put my mind to. I
        excel under duress and can isolate solutions quickly in the field. I am
        extremely resourceful and creative in my approach and bring a plethora
        of job knowledge due to my 'hands-on' experience.
        <br />
        My skills lend themselves to my honorable military service, working
        independently in the music industry as a performer and songwriter,
        freelancing as a private mechanic, and my industry-standard knowledge
        from working on major, state-funded commercial
        <a href="./pages/projects.html">projects</a> in my area. I am always
        looking to learn new technologies and improve my skills. Please take a
        look at my projects and feel free to reach out to me with any questions
        or opportunities.
